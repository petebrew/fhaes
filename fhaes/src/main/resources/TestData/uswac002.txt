Fire History Graphs: Fire History Graphs illustrate specific years when 
fires occurred and how many trees were scarred. They are available in both 
PDF and PNG formats. The graphs consist of 2 parts, both of which show the 
X axis (time line) at the bottom with the earliest year of information on 
the left and the latest on the right.
The Fire Index Plot is the topmost plot, and shows two variables: sample 
depth (the number of recording trees in each year) as a blue line along 
the left Y axis, compared with the percent trees scarred shown as gray bars 
along the right Y axis.
Below, the Fire Chronology Plot consists of horizontal lines representing
injuries by year on individual sampled trees. Symbols are overlain that 
denote the years containing the dendrochronologically-dated fire scars or
injuries. The sample ID of each tree is displayed to the right of each
line. The Composite Axis below represents the composite information from
all individual series. The symbols used to represent the fire scars or
injuries, and the filters used to determine the composite information,
are shown in the legend.
These graphs were created using the Fire History Analysis and Exploration
System (FHAES). See http://frames.nbii.gov/fhaes/ for more information.
